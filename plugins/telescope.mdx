## Overview

[Telescope](https://github.com/nvim-telescope/telescope.nvim) is a highly extendable fuzzy finder over lists. It provides an interactive interface for searching files, text, keymaps, and more.

## Installation

Telescope is configured with several dependencies in `lua/leyland/plugins/telescope.lua`:

```lua {2-9}
return {
	"nvim-telescope/telescope.nvim",
	branch = "0.1.x",
	dependencies = {
		"nvim-lua/plenary.nvim",
		{ "nvim-telescope/telescope-fzf-native.nvim", build = "make" },
		"nvim-tree/nvim-web-devicons",
		"folke/todo-comments.nvim",
	},
}
```

<Note>
  The `telescope-fzf-native` extension requires a C compiler and `make` to build. It significantly improves sorting performance.
</Note>

## Configuration

Telescope is configured with custom defaults and picker-specific settings:

### Default Settings

```lua {16-25}
telescope.setup({
	defaults = {
		path_display = { "filename_first" },
		mappings = {
			i = {
				["<C-k>"] = actions.move_selection_previous, -- move to prev result
				["<C-j>"] = actions.move_selection_next, -- move to next result
				["<C-q>"] = actions.send_selected_to_qflist + actions.open_qflist,
			},
		},
	},
})
```

<Accordion title="Configuration Breakdown">
  **path_display = { "filename_first" }**
  
  Displays the filename before the path in results, making it easier to identify files at a glance.
  
  **Custom Mappings (Insert Mode)**
  
  - `<C-k>`: Move to previous result
  - `<C-j>`: Move to next result
  - `<C-q>`: Send selected items to quickfix list and open it
</Accordion>

### Picker-Specific Settings

```lua {26-30}
telescope.setup({
	-- defaults ...
	pickers = {
		live_grep = {
			path_display = { "truncate" },
		},
	},
})
```

The `live_grep` picker uses truncated paths instead of filename-first to save space when displaying search results across many files.

### Extensions

```lua
telescope.load_extension("fzf")
```

The FZF native extension is loaded for improved sorting performance using FZF's algorithm.

## Keybindings

Telescope provides comprehensive keybindings for various search operations:

### File Operations

| Keybinding | Command | Description | Source |
|------------|---------|-------------|--------|
| `<leader><leader>` | `:Telescope find_files` | Fuzzy find files in current working directory | `telescope.lua:38` |
| `<leader>fr` | `:Telescope oldfiles` | Fuzzy find recent files | `telescope.lua:39` |

<Accordion title="File Finding Tips">
  **Finding Files (`<leader><leader>`)**
  
  - Start typing to filter files by name
  - Use fuzzy matching (e.g., "mdmpl" matches "my_demo_template")
  - Press `<CR>` to open the selected file
  
  **Recent Files (`<leader>fr`)**
  
  - Shows your most recently opened files
  - Sorted by recency
  - Great for quickly jumping back to files you were working on
</Accordion>

### Text Search

| Keybinding | Command | Description | Source |
|------------|---------|-------------|--------|
| `<leader>/` | `:Telescope live_grep` | Find string in current working directory | `telescope.lua:40` |
| `<leader>fc` | `:Telescope grep_string` | Find string under cursor in current working directory | `telescope.lua:41` |

<Accordion title="Text Search Tips">
  **Live Grep (`<leader>/`)**
  
  - Type your search query in real-time
  - Searches across all files in the project
  - Uses ripgrep for fast searching
  - Respects `.gitignore` by default
  
  **Grep String (`<leader>fc`)**
  
  - Automatically searches for the word under the cursor
  - No need to type the search term
  - Perfect for finding all occurrences of a variable or function
</Accordion>

### Special Searches

| Keybinding | Command | Description | Source |
|------------|---------|-------------|--------|
| `<leader>ft` | `:TodoTelescope` | Find TODO comments | `telescope.lua:42` |
| `<leader>fk` | `:Telescope keymaps` | Find configured keymaps | `telescope.lua:43` |

<Accordion title="TODO Comments">
  The `<leader>ft` keybinding integrates with the `todo-comments.nvim` plugin to find comments like:
  
  - `TODO:` - Tasks to be done
  - `FIXME:` - Known bugs to fix
  - `HACK:` - Temporary workarounds
  - `NOTE:` - Important notes
  - `WARNING:` - Warning messages
</Accordion>

## Telescope UI Navigation

When Telescope is open, you can navigate results using:

### Built-in Keybindings

| Key | Action |
|-----|--------|
| `<C-j>` | Move to next result (custom) |
| `<C-k>` | Move to previous result (custom) |
| `<C-n>` | Move to next result (default) |
| `<C-p>` | Move to previous result (default) |
| `<CR>` | Open selected file |
| `<C-x>` | Open in horizontal split |
| `<C-v>` | Open in vertical split |
| `<C-t>` | Open in new tab |
| `<C-q>` | Send to quickfix list (custom) |
| `<C-u>` | Scroll up in preview |
| `<C-d>` | Scroll down in preview |
| `<Esc>` | Close Telescope |

<Note>
  The custom `<C-j>` and `<C-k>` mappings provide a more intuitive navigation experience consistent with Vim's movement keys.
</Note>

## Usage Examples

### Finding and Opening Files

1. Press `<leader><leader>` to open file finder
2. Type part of the filename (e.g., "init")
3. Use `<C-j>`/`<C-k>` to navigate results
4. Press `<CR>` to open the selected file

### Searching for Text

1. Press `<leader>/` to open live grep
2. Type your search term (e.g., "function setup")
3. Results appear in real-time as you type
4. Navigate and open files containing the term

### Finding TODO Comments

1. Press `<leader>ft` to search for TODOs
2. Browse all TODO, FIXME, HACK, NOTE comments
3. Jump directly to any comment

### Discovering Keybindings

1. Press `<leader>fk` to open keymap finder
2. Search for any keybinding (e.g., "telescope")
3. See all available mappings and their descriptions

<Tip>
  Use `<leader>fk` (find keymaps) when you forget a keybinding - it's like a searchable cheatsheet!
</Tip>

## Performance Tips

<Accordion title="Large Codebases">
  For large projects:
  
  - The FZF native extension provides faster sorting
  - Telescope respects `.gitignore` to skip irrelevant files
  - Use more specific search terms to reduce result count
  - Consider using `find_files` with file type filters
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Optimizing Search">
  To make searches faster:
  
  - Use `grep_string` (`<leader>fc`) instead of typing when searching for the word under cursor
  - Add directories to `.gitignore` to exclude them from searches
  - Use file type patterns when you know the target file type
</Accordion>
