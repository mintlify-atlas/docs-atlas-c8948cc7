## Overview

Flash is a modern navigation plugin that lets you jump to any visible location on screen with just a few keystrokes. It's faster and more intuitive than traditional search-based navigation.

Location: `lua/leyland/plugins/flash.lua:1`

## Keybindings

### Core Navigation

| Key | Mode | Action | Description |
|-----|------|--------|-------------|
| `s` | Normal, Visual, Operator | Flash jump | Jump to any visible location |
| `S` | Normal, Visual, Operator | Flash Treesitter | Jump to Treesitter nodes |
| `r` | Operator | Remote Flash | Remote operation |
| `R` | Visual, Operator | Treesitter Search | Search Treesitter nodes |
| `<C-s>` | Command | Toggle Flash | Toggle Flash in search |

### Incremental Selection

| Key | Mode | Action | Description |
|-----|------|--------|-------------|
| `<C-space>` | Normal, Visual, Operator | Treesitter Selection | Start incremental selection |
| `<C-space>` | (while selecting) | Next | Expand to next node |
| `<BS>` | (while selecting) | Previous | Contract to previous node |

## Usage

### Basic Navigation

<Steps>
  <Step title="Trigger Flash">
    Press `s` in normal mode to activate Flash
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Type Target">
    Type one or two characters of your target location
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Jump">
    Labels appear on screen - type the label to jump instantly
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Tip>
Flash is context-aware: it shows labels based on what you type, making it faster than counting lines or using relative numbers.
</Tip>

### Treesitter Navigation

Press `S` to jump to semantic code elements:

<CodeGroup>
```lua Example: Jump to Function
-- Press 'S' in normal mode
-- Flash highlights all function nodes
-- Type label to jump to any function definition

function calculateTotal(items) -- You can jump here
  return items.reduce((sum, item) => sum + item.price, 0)
end

function processOrder(order) -- Or here
  local total = calculateTotal(order.items)
  return total
end
```

```javascript Example: Jump to JSX Element
// Press 'S' to see all JSX elements highlighted
// Jump directly to any component

function App() {
  return (
    <div>              {/* Jump to div */}
      <Header />       {/* Jump to Header */}
      <Main />         {/* Jump to Main */}
      <Footer />       {/* Jump to Footer */}
    </div>
  )
}
```
</CodeGroup>

### Incremental Selection

Press `<C-space>` to start selecting code based on Treesitter syntax:

```lua
-- Cursor on 'total'
local total = calculateTotal(order.items)

-- Press <C-space> once: selects 'total'
-- Press <C-space> again: selects 'calculateTotal(order.items)'
-- Press <C-space> again: selects entire assignment
-- Press <BS>: contract selection back
```

This simulates nvim-treesitter's incremental selection feature.

### Character Navigation

Flash enhances the built-in `f`, `t`, `F`, `T` motions:

```vim
;    " Repeat last motion forward
,    " Repeat last motion backward
```

Configuration at `lua/leyland/plugins/flash.lua:8-15`:

```lua
modes = {
  char = {
    char_actions = function(motion)
      return {
        [";"] = "next",
        [","] = "prev",
      }
    end,
  },
},
```

## Usage Patterns

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Quick Line Jump">
    Instead of using line numbers or `/` search:
    
    1. Press `s`
    2. Type the first letter of your target word
    3. Type the label that appears
    
    This is often faster than `:42` or `/function<CR>`
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Visual Selection">
    Flash works in visual mode:
    
    1. Press `v` to enter visual mode
    2. Press `s` to Flash jump
    3. Type target location
    
    This selects everything from cursor to target.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Operator Pending">
    Flash integrates with operators like `d`, `c`, `y`:
    
    ```vim
    ds<label>    " Delete from cursor to Flash target
    cs<label>    " Change from cursor to Flash target
    ys<label>    " Yank from cursor to Flash target
    ```
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Remote Operations">
    Press `r` in operator-pending mode for remote operations:
    
    ```vim
    dr<label>    " Delete at remote location (without moving cursor)
    cr<label>    " Change at remote location
    ```
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Advanced Features

### Search Integration

Press `<C-s>` during command-line search (`/` or `?`) to toggle Flash highlighting:

```vim
/myFunction<C-s>    " Toggle Flash labels on search matches
```

This lets you jump directly to any search match without pressing `n` repeatedly.

### Treesitter Search

Press `R` in visual or operator-pending mode to search within Treesitter nodes:

```lua
-- Search only within function bodies
-- Ignore comments and strings
```

This provides syntax-aware search that respects code structure.

## Configuration

Location: `lua/leyland/plugins/flash.lua:6-17`

Flash is configured with minimal options, keeping the default behavior while adding custom character navigation.

### VSCode Compatibility

```lua
vscode = true
```

Flash is enabled in VSCode Neovim, providing consistent navigation across environments.

### Lazy Loading

```lua
event = "VeryLazy"
```

Flash loads after startup to keep initial load time minimal.

## Comparison to Other Navigation

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="vs. EasyMotion/Hop" icon="arrows-left-right">
    Flash is faster with better Treesitter integration and more intelligent label placement.
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="vs. Search (/)" icon="magnifying-glass">
    Flash provides immediate visual feedback with labeled targets instead of cycling through matches.
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="vs. Relative Numbers" icon="hashtag">
    Flash is more intuitive - you type what you see, not what you count.
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="vs. Mouse" icon="computer-mouse">
    Flash keeps your hands on the keyboard while being just as fast and more precise.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

<Tip>
Flash is most effective when you know where you want to go visually. For searching unknown locations, traditional `/` search is still useful.
</Tip>

## Tips and Tricks

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Two-Character Search">
    Type two characters for more precision:
    
    - `s` + `fu` highlights all instances of "fu"
    - More specific targets = fewer labels to choose from
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Label Preference">
    Flash uses home row keys for labels (a, s, d, f, etc.) for faster typing.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Cross-Window Jumps">
    Flash works across splits - you can jump to any visible text in any window.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Combine with Operators">
    Flash shines when combined with Vim operators:
    
    - `ds<target>` - delete to target
    - `cs<target>` - change to target  
    - `>s<target>` - indent to target
    - `=s<target>` - format to target
  </Accordion>
