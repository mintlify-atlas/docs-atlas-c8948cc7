This page documents all custom keymaps configured in nvim-luffy. Keymaps provide shortcuts for common operations and window management.

## Leader Key

The leader key is mapped to **Space**:

```lua
vim.g.mapleader = " "
```

<Info>
The leader key is used as a prefix for many custom keybindings. When you see `<leader>` in a keymap, press the Space bar followed by the next key(s).
</Info>

## Active Keymaps

These are the currently configured keybindings:

### Window Management

Manage split windows efficiently.

| Keymap | Mode | Action | Description |
|--------|------|--------|-------------|
| `<leader>\|` | Normal | `<C-w>v` | Split window vertically |
| `<leader>sh` | Normal | `<C-w>s` | Split window horizontally |

<Accordion title="Window Split Examples">
  **Vertical Split:**
  1. Press `Space` (leader key)
  2. Press `|` (pipe character)
  3. A new vertical split opens to the right
  
  **Horizontal Split:**
  1. Press `Space` (leader key)
  2. Type `sh`
  3. A new horizontal split opens below
</Accordion>

### Buffer Management

Manage buffers (open files) with these keymaps.

| Keymap | Mode | Command | Description |
|--------|------|---------|-------------|
| `<leader>bd` | Normal | `:bd<CR>` | Close current buffer |
| `<leader>ba` | Normal | `:%bd<CR>` | Close all buffers |

<Warning>
`<leader>ba` closes **all** buffers. Make sure you've saved your work before using this command.
</Warning>

## Commented Keymaps

These keymaps are available in the config but currently disabled:

```lua
-- keymap.set("i", "jk", "<ESC>", {desc = "Exit Insert mode with jk"})
-- keymap.set("n", "<leader>nh", ":nohl<CR>", { desc = "Clear search highlights" })
```

### Quick Escape (Disabled)

- **Keymap**: `jk` in Insert mode
- **Action**: Exit insert mode (alternative to `<ESC>`)
- **Status**: Currently commented out

<Info>
Some users prefer typing `jk` to exit insert mode because it's easier to type than reaching for the Escape key. To enable this, uncomment the line in `keymaps.lua`.
</Info>

### Clear Search Highlights (Disabled)

- **Keymap**: `<leader>nh` in Normal mode
- **Action**: Clear search highlights with `:nohl`
- **Status**: Currently commented out

<Note>
This keymap is disabled because nvim-luffy has an autocommand that automatically clears search highlights when the cursor moves. See the [Autocommands](/configuration/autocommands) page for details.
</Note>

## Keymap Configuration

All keymaps use `vim.keymap.set()` for consistency:

```lua
local keymap = vim.keymap -- for conciseness

keymap.set(mode, lhs, rhs, { desc = "Description" })
```

**Parameters:**
- **mode**: The mode where the keymap applies (`n` = normal, `i` = insert, `v` = visual)
- **lhs**: The key combination to press (left-hand side)
- **rhs**: The action to execute (right-hand side)
- **desc**: Human-readable description of what the keymap does

## Mode Reference

| Mode | Symbol | Description |
|------|--------|-------------|
| Normal | `n` | Default mode for navigation and commands |
| Insert | `i` | Mode for typing text |
| Visual | `v` | Mode for selecting text |
| Command | `c` | Command-line mode |

## Source Code

All keymaps are configured in:
```
lua/leyland/core/keymaps.lua
```

<Accordion title="Adding Your Own Keymaps">
  To add custom keymaps, edit `lua/leyland/core/keymaps.lua` and use this pattern:
  
  ```lua
  keymap.set("n", "<leader>xx", "<cmd>YourCommand<CR>", { 
    desc = "Description of what this does" 
  })
  ```
  
  Replace:
  - `"n"` with your desired mode
  - `"<leader>xx"` with your key combination
  - `"<cmd>YourCommand<CR>"` with the command to execute
  - `desc` with a helpful description
</Accordion>
