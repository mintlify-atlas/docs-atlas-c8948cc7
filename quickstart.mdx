# Quick Start Guide

Welcome aboard! This guide will get you up and running with nvim-luffy in just 5 minutes. We'll cover the essential keybindings and workflows you need to be productive immediately.

<Note>
  **Leader Key**: nvim-luffy uses `Space` as the leader key. When you see `<leader>`, press the Space bar followed by the next key.
</Note>

## Essential Concepts

Before diving in, understand these core concepts:

- **Leader key (`<Space>`)**: Your primary modifier for custom commands
- **Normal mode**: Default mode for navigation and commands
- **Insert mode**: For typing text (press `i` to enter, `Esc` to exit)
- **Visual mode**: For selecting text (`v` for character, `V` for line)

## First Steps

<Steps>
  <Step title="Launch Neovim">
    Open Neovim from your terminal in any directory:

    ```bash
    # Open Neovim in current directory
    nvim

    # Or open a specific file
    nvim filename.js

    # Or open in a specific directory
    nvim ~/projects/my-app
    ```

    You'll be greeted with the custom One Piece-themed dashboard showing the Straw Hat Jolly Roger.

  </Step>

  <Step title="Open the File Explorer">
    Press `<Space>e` to toggle the file tree on the right side:

    ```
    <Space>e  - Toggle file explorer
    ```

    **File Tree Navigation:**
    - `j` / `k` - Move down/up
    - `l` - Open file or expand directory
    - `h` - Close directory
    - `a` - Create new file/folder
    - `r` - Rename file
    - `d` - Delete file
    - `x` - Cut file
    - `c` - Copy file
    - `p` - Paste file

    <Tip>
      The file explorer is powered by nvim-tree and shows on the right side. It includes git status indicators and custom icons.
    </Tip>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Find Files with Telescope">
    The fastest way to navigate is using Telescope's fuzzy finder.

    Press `<Space><Space>` to open the file finder:

    ```
    <Space><Space>  - Find files in current directory
    ```

    <img src="/images/telescope-files.png" alt="Telescope file finder" />

    **Telescope Navigation:**
    - `<C-j>` / `<C-k>` - Move down/up through results
    - `<CR>` (Enter) - Open selected file
    - `<C-q>` - Send results to quickfix list
    - `<Esc>` - Close Telescope

    **Other Telescope Commands:**
    ```lua
    <Space>/   - Live grep (search text in all files)
    <Space>fr  - Recent files
    <Space>fc  - Find word under cursor
    <Space>ft  - Find TODO comments
    <Space>fk  - Search keybindings
    ```

    <Note>
      Telescope uses fuzzy matching, so you don't need to type the exact filename. Try typing "usrdt" to find "user-details.tsx"!
    </Note>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Mark Files with Harpoon">
    Harpoon lets you mark important files and instantly jump between them - perfect for working on multiple related files.

    **Mark a file:**
    ```
    <Space>H  - Add current file to Harpoon
    ```

    **Open Harpoon menu:**
    ```
    <Space>h  - Toggle Harpoon quick menu
    ```

    **Jump to marked files:**
    ```
    <Space>1  - Jump to file 1
    <Space>2  - Jump to file 2
    <Space>3  - Jump to file 3
    ... up to <Space>9
    ```

    <Tip>
      Harpoon is ideal for marking files you're actively working on. Mark your route file, component, and test file for instant access.
    </Tip>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Edit and Navigate Code">
    Once you have a file open, use these essential navigation shortcuts:

    **Window Management:**
    ```
    <Space>|   - Split window vertically
    <Space>sh  - Split window horizontally
    <C-h/j/k/l> - Navigate between splits
    ```

    **Buffer Management:**
    ```
    <Space>bd  - Close current buffer
    <Space>ba  - Close all buffers
    ```

    **Fast Movement (Flash.nvim):**
    ```
    s          - Jump to any location (type 2 chars)
    S          - Jump to treesitter node
    <C-Space>  - Incremental treesitter selection
    ```

## Working with Code

### LSP Features

nvim-luffy comes with full LSP support. Once you open a file with an LSP server installed, you get:

**Auto-completion:**
- Just start typing and suggestions appear automatically
- `<C-j>` / `<C-k>` - Navigate suggestions
- `<Tab>` - Accept suggestion
- `<C-Space>` - Manually trigger completion
- `<C-e>` - Close completion menu

<img src="/images/completion-demo.png" alt="Auto-completion" />

**Code Navigation:**
```vim
gd   - Go to definition
gD   - Go to declaration
gi   - Go to implementation
gr   - Show references
K    - Show hover documentation
```

**Code Actions:**
```vim
<Space>ca  - Code actions (imports, fixes, refactors)
<Space>rn  - Rename symbol
```

**Diagnostics:**
```vim
]d  - Next diagnostic
[d  - Previous diagnostic
<Space>d  - Show line diagnostics
```

### Search and Replace

**Search in current file:**
```vim
/pattern    - Search forward
?pattern    - Search backward
n           - Next match
N           - Previous match
```

**Search across files:**
```vim
<Space>/    - Live grep (search in all files)
<Space>fc   - Find word under cursor in all files
```

**Find TODOs and notes:**
```vim
<Space>ft   - Find all TODO, FIX, NOTE, HACK, WARN, PERF comments
```

### Formatting and Linting

**Auto-format on save** is enabled by default for supported file types.

**Manual formatting:**
```vim
<Space>mp   - Format current buffer (in normal or visual mode)
```

Supported formatters:
- **Prettier**: JavaScript, TypeScript, JSON, HTML, CSS, Markdown
- **Stylua**: Lua
- **Black & isort**: Python

## Typical Workflows

### Workflow 1: Starting a New Feature

<Steps>
  <Step title="Navigate to your project">
    ```bash
    cd ~/projects/my-app
    nvim
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Find the file you need">
    Press `<Space><Space>` and type the filename (fuzzy matching works!):
    ```
    <Space><Space>
    Type: "usrcmp" → finds "UserComponent.tsx"
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Mark important files with Harpoon">
    As you open related files, mark them:
    ```
    <Space>H  (in UserComponent.tsx)
    <Space>H  (in user.service.ts)
    <Space>H  (in user.test.ts)
    ```

    Now jump between them instantly with `<Space>1`, `<Space>2`, `<Space>3`
  </Step>

  <Step title="Use LSP features while coding">
    - Let auto-completion help you (`<Tab>` to accept)
    - Press `K` to see documentation
    - Use `gd` to jump to definitions
    - Run `<Space>ca` for quick fixes and imports
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Workflow 2: Debugging an Issue

<Steps>
  <Step title="Search for the error message">
    ```
    <Space>/
    Type: "Cannot read property"
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Navigate through matches">
    Use `<C-j>` / `<C-k>` to browse results, Enter to open
  </Step>

  <Step title="Check diagnostics">
    ```
    ]d / [d  - Jump between errors
    <Space>d - See detailed error message
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Find related code">
    Place cursor on a function/variable and:
    ```
    gr - See all references
    gi - Go to implementation
    ```
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Workflow 3: Code Review

<Steps>
  <Step title="Find todos and notes">
    ```
    <Space>ft  - See all TODO, FIX, NOTE comments
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Check recent files">
    ```
    <Space>fr  - Browse recently edited files
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Use splits for comparison">
    ```
    <Space>|  - Split vertically
    <C-h/l>   - Jump between splits
    ```
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Tips for Maximum Productivity

<Tip>
  **Use Harpoon for active files**: Don't navigate the same 3-4 files repeatedly with Telescope. Mark them with Harpoon (`<Space>H`) and jump instantly with `<Space>1-9`.
</Tip>

<Tip>
  **Learn Flash.nvim**: Press `s` followed by any 2 characters to jump anywhere on screen. It's faster than using `hjkl` for long distances.
</Tip>

<Tip>
  **Leverage LSP**: Use `gd` (go to definition) instead of searching. Let the language server guide you through the codebase.
</Tip>

<Tip>
  **Search keybindings**: Forgot a shortcut? Press `<Space>fk` to search all keybindings with Telescope.
</Tip>

<Warning>
  If you're coming from VSCode or another IDE, resist the urge to use arrow keys or mouse. Learning Vim motions (`hjkl`, `w`, `b`, `{`, `}`) will make you significantly faster.
</Warning>
