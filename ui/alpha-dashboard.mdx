nvim-luffy features a custom Alpha dashboard with a One Piece themed ASCII art and quick navigation buttons.

## Dashboard Features

The Alpha dashboard appears when you launch Neovim without opening a file. It displays:

- **One Piece ASCII Art**: A custom Luffy-themed ASCII art header
- **Inspirational Quote**: "Maybe the One Piece was the commits you made along the way."
- **Quick Action Buttons**: Fast access to common tasks

## Quick Action Buttons

The dashboard provides three main shortcuts:

<CardGroup cols={3}>
  <Card title="Find File" icon="magnifying-glass">
    Press `f` to open Telescope file finder
    
    ```vim
    :Telescope find_files
    ```
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="Recent Files" icon="clock-rotate-left">
    Press `r` to browse recently opened files
    
    ```vim
    :Telescope oldfiles
    ```
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="Quit" icon="right-from-bracket">
    Press `q` to exit Neovim
    
    ```vim
    :qa
    ```
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## Dashboard Quote

The footer displays a playful One Piece reference:

```
"Maybe the One Piece was the commits you made along the way."
```

This quote appears in a dimmed color (Comment highlight group) between the ASCII art and the action buttons.

## Configuration

The Alpha dashboard is configured in `lua/leyland/plugins/alpha.lua`:

**File:** `~/workspace/source/lua/leyland/plugins/alpha.lua`

```lua lua/leyland/plugins/alpha.lua
return {
  "goolord/alpha-nvim",
  event = "VimEnter",
  config = function()
    local alpha = require("alpha")
    local dashboard = require("alpha.themes.dashboard")

    -- Set custom ASCII art header
    dashboard.section.header.val = {
      -- One Piece ASCII art (41 lines)
    }

    -- Set menu buttons
    dashboard.section.buttons.val = {
      dashboard.button("f", "  Find file", ":Telescope find_files <CR>"),
      dashboard.button("r", "  Recent files", ":Telescope oldfiles <CR>"),
      dashboard.button("q", "  Quit", ":qa<CR>"),
    }

    -- Set footer with One Piece quote
    dashboard.section.footer.val = {
      "",
      '"Maybe the One Piece was the commits you made along the way."',
      "",
    }

    -- Configure layout
    dashboard.config.layout = {
      { type = "padding", val = 2 },
      dashboard.section.header,
      { type = "padding", val = 2 },
      dashboard.section.footer,  -- Quote
      { type = "padding", val = 2 },
      dashboard.section.buttons,
      { type = "padding", val = 1 },
    }

    dashboard.section.footer.opts.hl = "Comment"
    alpha.setup(dashboard.opts)

    -- Disable folding on alpha buffer
    vim.cmd([[autocmd FileType alpha setlocal nofoldenable]])
  end,
}
```

## Customization

### Changing the ASCII Art

Edit `dashboard.section.header.val` in `alpha.lua` to replace the One Piece ASCII art with your own design.

### Adding More Buttons

Add new buttons to `dashboard.section.buttons.val`:

```lua
dashboard.button("e", "  New file", ":ene <BAR> startinsert <CR>")
```

### Customizing the Quote

Modify `dashboard.section.footer.val` to change the inspirational quote:

```lua
dashboard.section.footer.val = {
  "",
  '"Your custom quote here"',
  "",
}
```

<Note>
  The dashboard only appears when Neovim is launched without opening a file. Folding is disabled on the Alpha buffer for a cleaner appearance.
