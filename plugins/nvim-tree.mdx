## Overview

[nvim-tree](https://github.com/nvim-tree/nvim-tree.lua) is a file explorer for Neovim written in Lua. It provides a tree-based view of your project's file structure with git integration and customizable keybindings.

## Installation

nvim-tree is configured in `lua/leyland/plugins/nvim-tree.lua`:

```lua {2-3}
return {
	"nvim-tree/nvim-tree.lua",
	dependencies = "nvim-tree/nvim-web-devicons",
}
```

The `nvim-web-devicons` dependency provides file type icons in the tree view.

## Main Keybinding

The primary keybinding to toggle the file explorer:

| Keybinding | Command | Description | Source |
|------------|---------|-------------|--------|
| `<leader>e` | `:NvimTreeFindFileToggle` | Toggle file explorer on current file | `nvim-tree.lua:5` |

<Accordion title="NvimTreeFindFileToggle Behavior">
  This command does three things:
  
  1. **Opens** the tree if it's closed
  2. **Closes** the tree if it's already open
  3. **Finds** the current file in the tree when opening
  
  This means when you press `<leader>e`, nvim-tree will open and automatically scroll to show your current file's location in the project structure.
</Accordion>

## Configuration

### Netrw Disable

```lua {11-12}
vim.g.loaded_netrw = 1
vim.g.loaded_netrwPlugin = 1
```

nvim-tree disables Neovim's built-in file explorer (netrw) to avoid conflicts.

### View Settings

```lua {29-33}
nvimtree.setup({
	view = {
		width = 50,
		relativenumber = true,
		side = "right",
	},
})
```

<Accordion title="View Configuration Details">
  **width = 50**
  
  Sets the tree window width to 50 columns. This provides enough space to see file names while preserving screen real estate for editing.
  
  **relativenumber = true**
  
  Enables relative line numbers in the tree view, making it easier to jump to files using count-based motions (e.g., `5j` to go down 5 files).
  
  **side = "right"**
  
  Opens the file tree on the right side of the screen instead of the default left side. This is a personal preference that can help with certain workflows.
</Accordion>

### Renderer Settings

```lua {34-46}
renderer = {
	indent_markers = {
		enable = true,
	},
	icons = {
		glyphs = {
			folder = {
				arrow_closed = "",
				arrow_open = "",
			},
		},
	},
},
```

<Accordion title="Renderer Configuration Details">
  **indent_markers.enable = true**
  
  Shows visual indent guides in the tree, making it easier to see the directory hierarchy at a glance.
  
  **folder.arrow_closed/open**
  
  Uses custom arrow glyphs (  and ) to indicate folder state:
  -  : Closed/collapsed folder
  -  : Open/expanded folder
</Accordion>

### Actions

```lua {47-53}
actions = {
	open_file = {
		window_picker = {
			enable = false,
		},
	},
},
```

Disables the window picker, so files always open in the most recently used window instead of prompting you to choose.

### Filters

```lua {54-56}
filters = {
	custom = { ".DS_Store" },
},
```

Hides `.DS_Store` files (macOS system files) from the tree view.

### Git Settings

```lua {57-59}
git = {
	ignore = false,
},
```

<Note>
  With `git.ignore = false`, nvim-tree will show files that are in `.gitignore`. By default, nvim-tree hides gitignored files. This setting ensures you can see all files in your project.
</Note>

## Custom Keybindings

nvim-tree uses custom keybindings when the tree is focused:

### Navigation and File Operations

```lua {23-24}
vim.keymap.set("n", "l", api.node.open.edit, opts("Open"))
vim.keymap.set("n", "h", api.node.navigate.parent_close, opts("Close Directory"))
```

| Key | Action | Description | Source |
|-----|--------|-------------|--------|
| `l` | Open file/folder | Open file in editor or expand folder | `nvim-tree.lua:23` |
| `h` | Close directory | Collapse folder or move to parent | `nvim-tree.lua:24` |

<Accordion title="Why l and h?">
  These custom bindings provide a more intuitive navigation experience:
  
  - `h` (left in Vim) = go up/close (collapse folders)
  - `l` (right in Vim) = go down/open (expand folders or open files)
  
  This matches the mental model of moving left to go "up" the tree hierarchy and right to go "down" into folders.
</Accordion>

### Default Keybindings

In addition to the custom bindings, nvim-tree loads all default keybindings:

```lua {20}
api.config.mappings.default_on_attach(bufnr)
```

Some useful default bindings include:

| Key | Action |
|-----|--------|
| `<CR>` | Open file or expand/collapse folder |
| `o` | Open file |
| `<C-v>` | Open file in vertical split |
| `<C-x>` | Open file in horizontal split |
| `<C-t>` | Open file in new tab |
| `a` | Create new file/directory |
| `d` | Delete file |
| `r` | Rename file |
| `x` | Cut file |
| `c` | Copy file |
| `p` | Paste file |
| `R` | Refresh tree |
| `q` | Close tree |
| `g?` | Show help |

<Tip>
  Press `g?` when the tree is focused to see all available keybindings.
</Tip>

## Usage Examples

### Opening the Tree

1. Press `<leader>e` to toggle the file explorer
2. The tree opens on the right side with your current file highlighted
3. Use `h` and `l` to navigate the tree structure

### Creating Files and Directories

1. Press `a` (add) when focused on the tree
2. Type the file/directory name
3. Add a trailing `/` to create a directory (e.g., `new-folder/`)
4. Press `<CR>` to confirm

### Managing Files

<Accordion title="Renaming">
  1. Navigate to the file
  2. Press `r`
  3. Edit the name
  4. Press `<CR>` to confirm
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Deleting">
  1. Navigate to the file
  2. Press `d`
  3. Confirm the deletion
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Copying/Moving">
  1. Navigate to the file
  2. Press `c` to copy or `x` to cut
  3. Navigate to destination
  4. Press `p` to paste
</Accordion>

### Opening Files in Different Windows

| Action | Keybinding |
|--------|------------|
| Open in current window | `l` or `<CR>` |
| Open in vertical split | `<C-v>` |
| Open in horizontal split | `<C-x>` |
| Open in new tab | `<C-t>` |

## Git Integration

nvim-tree shows git status indicators next to files:

| Icon | Status |
|------|--------|
| ✗ | Deleted |
| ✚ | Staged |
| ✹ | Modified |
| ★ | Renamed |
| ═ | Unmerged |
| ? | Untracked |

<Note>
  Git status indicators update automatically when you make changes or perform git operations.
</Note>

## Tips and Tricks

<Accordion title="Quick File Creation">
  To quickly create nested files:
  
  1. Press `a` in the tree
  2. Type the full path: `src/components/Button.tsx`
  3. nvim-tree automatically creates missing directories
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Filtering Files">
  - Press `f` to filter files by pattern
  - Press `F` to clear the filter
  - Use `.` prefix to show/hide hidden files (press `H`)
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Bookmarking">
  - Press `m` to bookmark a file
  - Press `bd` to delete a bookmark
  - Bookmarks appear with a special icon
</Accordion>

## Performance

nvim-tree is optimized for large projects:

- Lazy loads directory contents
- Only renders visible nodes
- Caches file system information
- Respects `.gitignore` for filtering (when `git.ignore = true`)
